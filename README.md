# Hi! I'm Andr√°s.

I'm currently pursuing a joint PhD on system identification at:

- the [MECO research team](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/meco) at KU Leuven (Belgium),
- the MATLAB Laboratory at Budapest University of Technology and Economics (Hungary).

I am the original author of the open source CSDR and OpenWebRX packages for Software Defined Radio.
